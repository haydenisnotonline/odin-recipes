# odin-recipes

This is the Recipes project for The Odin Project made to test my knowledge on basic HTML. After completion, I should know the bare basics of how to put content onto a webpage using pure HTML, with only the core tags.

On the pages in this project will be different recipes and the steps to make them, using lists element tags in HTML.
